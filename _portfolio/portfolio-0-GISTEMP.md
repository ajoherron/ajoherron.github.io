title: "GISS Surface Temperature Anomaly Detection and Analysis (GISTEMP)"
excerpt: "GISTEMP, NASA's global temperature analysis system, is the scientific standard for measuring Earth's warming. Temperature anomalies show how much warmer/cooler a region is compared to its typical temperature in a reference period.<br><br>

I've modernized GISTEMPv4 through:<br>
- Performance: Achieved 2x speed increase through vectorization<br>
- Code Quality: Reduced codebase from ~10,000 to 1,000 lines while maintaining full functionality<br>
- Modernization: Leveraged NumPy, Pandas, and Xarray for improved data handling<br><br>

The visualization shows global temperature anomalies from 1880-2024, relative to the 1951-1980 baseline.<br><br>
