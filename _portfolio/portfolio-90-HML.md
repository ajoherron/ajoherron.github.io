title: "Diagnosing Respiratory Disease from Chest X-Rays using Computer Vision"
excerpt: "In my healthcare machine learning course, I undertook a project focused on predicting a patient's diagnosis from a chest X-ray, identifying one of four potential outcomes: healthy, COVID, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. For this challenge, I compared two CNNs (ResNet18 and VGG16), an Ensemble VAE (Variational AutoEncoder), and a self-supervised MAE-ViT (Masked AutoEncoder Visual Transformer). While all models showed promise, the VGG and ResNet models demonstrated the most robust performance, reaching overall precisions of 0.88 and 0.85, respectively. This project highlights the potential of computer vision in radiology (specifically multi-class diagnoses).
