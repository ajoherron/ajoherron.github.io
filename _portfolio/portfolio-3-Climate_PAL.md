title: "Climate PAL: Climate Analysis through Conversational AI"
excerpt: "Climate data has some serious drawbacks that limit its utility:<br>
- An overwhelming amount of data, which can be hard to manage (>30 PB in CMIP6 alone)<br>
- Complex naming conventions that even scientists struggle with<br>
- Relatively obscure data types and packages (e.g., NetCDF, Xarray)<br><br>

Climate PAL is a chat interface that allows users to interactive with public climate data using plain English queries. Not only does this expedite hypothesis testing for scientists, but it makes climate data accessible to a non-technical audience.<br><br>

From a user's query, Climate PAL determines the relevant dataset/variable and can plot/analyze results for the user. Built using LangChain and OpenAI for natural language processing, Climate PAL can chat with users to determine exactly what they want to get out of the data.<br><br>

Selected for presentation at both:<br>
- *Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*<br>
- *American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting*<br><br>
