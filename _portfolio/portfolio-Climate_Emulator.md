Despite being the industry standard, numerical climate models are:
- slow (take months to run)
- computationally intensive (requiring 88 CPUs as a bare minimum)
- excessively complex (include hundreds of variables although most scientists are only interested in a few)

To address this issue, I've developed a ResNet-based model that emulates NASA's Global Climate Model for precipitation predictions. So far, I've:
- Achieved *state of the art* results (surpassing the best published result)
- Reduced computation time from ~2 months to 5 minutes

Although in early stages, this work has major implications for the role of deep learning in supplementing climate research.
