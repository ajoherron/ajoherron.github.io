title: "Next Word Prediction"
excerpt: "

For my Computational Cognitive Modeling course,  I conducted a comparative analysis of the next-word prediction abilities across an LSTM model, a pre-trained T5 Hugging Face Transformer, and human participants. Specifically, I trained the LSTM model and evaluated all methods using a dataset comprising over 5,500 articles. In this evaluation, the last word of each article's title served as the target for prediction. Overall, the Transformer exhibited superior performance compared to the LSTM, achieving accuracies of 9.7% and 7.5%, respectively. However, our survey involving 15 human participants significantly surpassed the performance of both neural networks, achieving an accuracy of 59.3% on a subset of questions.
