title: "Loan Default Prediction"
excerpt: "In my Finance Machine Learning course, I developed a robust data processing pipeline to clean 1 million rows of real-world loan data and predict probabilities of default for small companies. Through extensive research and experimentation with various models, I determined that XGBoost was the most effective for this task. Additionally, I found that clever feature engineering was particularly crucial for enhancing model predictions. My project was recognized as one of the top 4 performers in a competitive evaluation of all students' projects.
