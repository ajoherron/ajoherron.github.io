title: "Climate Model Processing Pipeline"
excerpt: "In order to compare climate model experiments from around the globe, they need to meet the same standards and be formatted identically. The international standard set is by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).<br><br>

I've created a pipeline that has automated our CMIP processing, reducing completion time from 2 weeks to 2 days. This pipeline is now used to process every climate experiment that passes through NASA, processing hundreds of terabytes of data annually.<br><br>

Additionally, as Data Curator at GISS, I'm responsible for the management of all our data (on the order of Petabytes). This includes what we publish to ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation), the primary platform for accessing and comparing climate model data worldwide.<br><br>
