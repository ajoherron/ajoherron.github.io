title: "Machine Learning Algorithm Optimization"
excerpt: "In my Advanced Python course, I developed logistic regression and decision tree algorithms from scratch, then optimized their speed while preserving accuracy. With logistic regression, I achieved a 298X increase in speed by implementing stochastic gradient descent alongside Numba. For my decision tree model, I implemented a random feature subset approach, focusing on a subset rather than the entire feature set. Additionally, I introduced customizable settings to specify the number of features and values for the decision tree. These optimizations led to a 76X increase in speed.
