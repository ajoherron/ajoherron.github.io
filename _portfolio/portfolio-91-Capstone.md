title: "Masking Methane Pixels using Satellite Data"
excerpt: "During Fall 2022, I collaborated with Orbio Earth, an innovative startup dedicated to providing methane emissions insights for energy assets worldwide. For my capstone project, I developed computer vision (U-Net) and statistical models, utilizing thresholds determined by aggregate statistics, to identify methane presence in images. Throughout this project, I learned the importance of normalizing datasets with imbalanced distributions, given that the majority of pixels did not contain methane. Additionally, I realized the potency of statistical approaches, as the custom statistical model performed better than the U-Net model.
