Climate PAL is a chat interface that makes researcher's lives easier and empowers a non-technical audience to access climate data. From a plain-English query from a user, Climate PAL determines the relevant dataset/variable and can plot/analyze results for the user. Built using LangChain and OpenAI for natural language processing.

Selected for presentation at both:
- *Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*
- *American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting*
