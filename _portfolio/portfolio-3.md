title: "Loan Default Prediction"
excerpt: "For the final project of my Data Science in Finance course, I created a harness that was capable of cleaning over 1MM rows of real-world loan data and predicting the probability of default for new applicants. After much research into loan prediction modeling and experimental model comparison, I determined that an XGBoost model would have the best performance for the task. Ultimately, my project was selected as a top 4 performer."
