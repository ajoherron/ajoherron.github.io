title: "How will your Tweet be Received?"
excerpt: "For the final project in my Natural Language Processing course, I replicated a study aimed at predicting the aggregate sentiment of tweet replies (categorized as positive, neutral, or negative). For this task, I trained a Bi-LSTM and CNN on 26k tweets I gathered from twitter. Notably, the Bi-LSTM slightly outperformed the CNN on the hand-labeled test set, achieving an accuracy of 59% and coming within 2% of the top published results.
