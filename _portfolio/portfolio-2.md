title: "Predicting Sentiment of Tweet Replies"
excerpt: "For my final project in my Natural Language Processing course, I chose to reproduce a study that sought to predict the aggregate sentiment of a given tweet's replies (as positive, neutral, or negative). I used both a Bi-LSTM and a CNN model for this task. Overall, I was able to come within 2% of the top published results, with the Bi-LSTM slightly outperfomring the CNN on a hand-labeled test set. <br/>
