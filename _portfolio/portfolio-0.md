title: "Diagnosing Respiratory Disease from Chest X-Rays using Computer Vision"
excerpt: "In my healthcare machine learning course, I worked on a project centered around predicting a given patient's diagnosis from an X-ray of their chest. Specifically, I sought to diagnose from one of 4 potential outcomes: healthy, COVID, lung opacity, and viral pneumonio. To this end, I created two convolutional neural networks (ResNet18 and VGG16), an Ensemble VAE (Variational AutoEncoder), and a self-supervised MAE-ViT (Masked AutoEncoder Vision Transformer). Overall, the VGG and ResNet models appeared to have the best overall performance (in terms of multiclass AUC). This project shows the potential for computer vision in the field of radiology, and how AI can be a powerful tool used by radiologists in the future.
