title: "ResNet-based Climate Model Emulator"
excerpt: "Despite being the industry standard, numerical climate models are:<br>
- slow (take months to run)<br>
- computationally intensive (requiring 88 CPUs as a bare minimum)<br>
- excessively complex (include hundreds of variables although most scientists are only interested in a few)<br><br>

To address this issue, I've developed a ResNet-based model that emulates NASA's Global Climate Model for precipitation predictions. So far, I've:<br>
- Achieved *state of the art* results (surpassing the best published result) for precipitation predictions<br>
- Reduced computation time from ~2 months to 5 minutes<br><br>

Although in early stages, this work has major implications for the role of deep learning in supplementing climate research.<br><br>
