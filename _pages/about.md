Welcome to my website! I'm passionate about leveraging Data Science across various scientific domains, including Climate Science. My interests lie in machine learning, uncovering trends within data, crafting clear visualizations, continuously learning new technologies, all while emphasizing robust and efficient coding practices.

Currently, I work as a Scientific Programmer at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, where I work at the forefront of climate research. My responsibilities include rewriting the GISS Surface Temperature Anomaly Detection and Analysis (GISTEMP), a globally utilized metric for monitoring climate change (refer to the plot below). Additionally, I've taken full responsibility for automating the climate model processing pipeline, significantly enhancing efficiency.

My academic journey includes a Master of Science in Data Science from New York University, where I tackled diverse data science problems including natural language processing, computer vision, and financial analytics (feel free to take a look at my Portfolio!). I earned my Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics from Columbia University, where I developed strong math skills through rigorous physics studies, pursued environmental science applications, and complemented my education with a minor in History.

Feel free to explore my website to check out my work and interests. Don't hesitate to reach out via email or LinkedIn to connect!
