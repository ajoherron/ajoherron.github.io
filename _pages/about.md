At NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, I build systems that merge ML with climate science, modernize crucial code, and process petabytes of data:

- Created a ResNet model that emulates NASA's climate simulations in 5 minutes instead of 2 months, setting a new state-of-the-art for global precipitation predictions
- Rebuilt GISTEMP—NASA's global temperature analysis pipeline used by climate scientists worldwide—cutting runtime by 50% while modernizing the codebase (see plot below)
- Automated GISS's climate model processing pipeline, reducing experiment processing time from 2 weeks to 2 days
- Developing a chatbot for climate science analysis (accepted for presentation at NeurIPS and AGU 2024)

Before NASA, I combined ML and physics research—publishing a first-author paper on ocean dynamics, analyzing cloud measurements for NASA's ACTIVATE mission, and automating research workflows at Nuance Communications / Microsoft. M.S. in Data Science from NYU, B.S. in Applied Physics from Columbia.
