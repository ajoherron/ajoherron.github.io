Animal Enthusiast
======
I have a lovely cat named Vlad. He enjoys playing fetch with index cards and disrupting my coding when it's almost his dinner time. Vlad has earned a well-deserved reputation as a world-class sleeper. Notably, he has a penchant for curling up in sinks, a skill that never fails to impress.

Running
======
I really enjoy running, and back in the day I ran some pretty long runs. Back in 2017 I ran the perimeter of Manhattan (34.58 miles in 5:00:17 for an 8:41 min/mile pace). More recently, I ran an unorganized marathon along the Manhattan coastline in 3:29:48 for an 8:00 min/mile pace. These days, I prefer to run shorter, slower runs in various NYC parks.

Cooking
======
I'm a big fan of cooking, finding restaurants, and generally anything food related. I try to explore new recipes often, and I think there are few better things than a good meal with good company. I think Tina Fey / Liz Lemon said it best: "I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich." Here's some duck breasts I made this past holiday season.

Games
======
Since 2019, I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons and various other games with a group of friends. I feel very fortunate to be able to see everyone weekly!

Reading
======
Content

I'm an avid reader, particularly enjoying fantasy, science fiction, history, and comedy. Recently, I read through Frank Herbert's Dune series, which was some of the most fun I've ever had reading. I've also gotten into audiobooks lately. Did you know the NY Public Library offers audiobooks? Highly recommended.
