Animal Enthusiast
======
I have a lovely cat named Vlad who particularly enjoys playing fetch with balled-up index cards. He's earned a well-deserved repuation as a world class sleeper, with a particular talent for turning any sink into a bed.

Running
======
One of my favorite things is exploring NYC on foot. Some favorite memories include running Manhattan's perimeter (35 miles) and doing a solo marathon along its coastline. These days, you'll find me enjoying much shorter runs through the city's parks.

Cooking & Food
======
I think there are few things better than a good meal with good company. I love exploring both restaurants and recipes. I think Tina Fey said it best: "I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich."

Games
======
Since 2019, I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons and various other games with a group of friends. I feel very fortunate to be able to see everyone weekly!

Reading
======
I'm an avid reader, particularly enjoying fantasy and science fiction. Mostly recently, my favorite series have been Dune, A Song of Ice and Fire, and Lord of the Rings.
