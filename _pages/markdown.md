Proud Cat Dad
======
Vlad is a king of string chasing, has set records for hours slept in a day, and is currently a voice coach for many of Hollywood's top actors and artists. Not to mention his extensive experience fitting perfectly in sinks.

Running (in circles)
======
I really enjoy running, and back in the day I ran some pretty long runs. The image below is the path I took around the perimeter of Manhattan in 2017 (34.58 miles in 5 hours and 17 seconds). I've also run an unorganized marathon around the perimeter of Manhattan (3 hours, 29 minutes, and 48 seconds for an average pace of 8:00 min/mile). More recently, I've been running much slower and much shorter distances in Central Park.

Amateur Chef
======
I'm a big fan of cooking, eating, and anything food related! I try to explore new recipes and restaurants often, and I think there are few better things than a good meal with good company. I think Tina Fey / Liz Lemon said it best: "I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich." Here's some duck breasts I made this past holiday season.

Dungeons and Dragons Nerd!
======
Since 2019, I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons (5e) with a group of friends from college. I count myself very lucky to be able to see everyone weekly!
